# Log Me In

**LogMeIn** is a utility app designed for Android devices that allows users to monitor and interact with various device settings. The app features visual indicators (circles) that represent the current status of different system conditions, such as notifications, battery level, Wi-Fi connection, and more.

## Features

- **Wi-Fi Network**: Monitors the status of the device's Wi-Fi connection and network status.
- **Notifications reading**: Detects when a notification is received and checks it's content.
- **Volume Check**: Monitors the volume level of the device to ensure it’s set within a specific range.
- **Battery Level & Charging**: Tracks the device's battery status, including whether the device is charging or connected to a power source.
- **Background App Monitoring**: Monitor apps that has been recently active, and looks for a specific app.
- **Proximity Sensor**: Detects whether the device is close to the user's face or a nearby object using the proximity sensor.

## Purpose

The purpose of **LogMeIn** is to provide a challenging experience that simulates an "escape room" style puzzle. Users must complete several checks and pass specific conditions to proceed. Each check verifies a critical system setting (e.g., battery level, wifi network, proximity) before they can continue. This app is designed to make the login process more difficult, requiring users to engage with various aspects of their device's settings and pass all challenges to proceed.

## Gameplay

**LogMeIn** doesn't follow the traditional "gameplay" model, but here’s how users interact with the app:

- **Circles**: The nine circles represent different settings (e.g., battery level, screen time, Wi-Fi connection, etc.). Each circle updates in real time based on the system's current status. They change color from red to green as each condition is met.
- **Slider**: Users should modify the slider position based on the current battery level of their device.
- **Unlock Button**: The button remains disabled until all conditions are met, ensuring that the user has correctly configured their device settings.
